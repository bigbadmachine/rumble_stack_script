Rumble StackScript
==================

A Linode StackScript designed for Rails Rumble usage. It's sometimes opinionated, sometimes lenient.

**NOTE:** This is seriously alpha right now. It is on GitHub solely so that others may hack on it and improve it. Don't use it for anything important yet.

Opinions
========

* You want rvm
* Your nonprivileged user who runs the app is named "deploy"
* You want to use passenger as a user process under the deploy user (todo)

Leniency
========

* Available Persistence Engines
  * MySQL (todo)
  * PostgreSQL (todo)
  * MongoDB (todo)
  * Redis (todo)
  * CouchDB (todo)
* Available Servers
  * Apache (todo)
  * nginx (todo)
  * node.js (todo)
